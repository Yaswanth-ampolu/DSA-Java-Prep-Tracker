# 🚀 Complete Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Journey

Welcome to my complete DSA preparation repository! This repo contains everything I have learned, code snippets, resources, and a **custom-built progress tracker** to help you master Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 🌟 Live Progress Tracker
**Don't just watch tutorials—track your progress!** I have built a fully interactive, mobile-friendly Syllabus Tracker. You can use it to watch lectures, mark them as complete, and manage your assignments.

> **Tip:** You can add the link above to your mobile home screen for an app-like experience!
